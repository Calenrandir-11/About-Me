# About-Me
👋 Hello! Welcome to Samuel Cope's GitHub README.
📖 Fun fact: my user name, Calenrandir-11, is a spin on Mithrandir from the Lord of the Rings. Mithrandir is another name for Gandalf the Grey, and is Sindarin for "grey pilgram", and hence, Calenrandir means        "[insert my favorite color] pilgram," have fun finding out what that means on your own! It's very nerdy, and I love it. 🤓
🔭 I am currently an undergraduate student studying astrophysics. I am also taking a computer science minor, as management of large datasets from upcoming astronomy instruments will be part of my career. This GitHUb README is part of my initial foray into Computer Science!
🏢 Here's my LinkedIn for career history: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-cope-9445762b1/" (will be updated soon)
🎹 As for hobbies, I enjoy playing classical piano (particulary Chopin), reading, and paper modeling. I also enjoy kite flying! 
That's about it for now. I do aspirationally hope to make something cool with code someday outside my career, whatever that may be, so we'll see what happens there long term!
Bye for now!
